# websiteMonitor
I had an interesting issue where our monitoring service was telling us that the webserver was operational however users had told us that the application was broken.  I wrote something to test the application and write the response to a text file.  new to python so sure it can be improved!

the script makes a request and then prints the response to a text file.  Later iterations will include adding some red/green lights!
